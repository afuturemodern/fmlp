      <Paragraph>
        the current system forces social innovators to choose between lacking
        the resources they need to see through their vision, or selling out and
        corrupting their vision for co-opting interests. we need new
        institutions, economies, and networks, across technology, finance,
        power, creativity and information, which reward and liberate those who
        reward and liberate their communities, rather than those than exclude,
        extract from and exploit them.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        future modern is the interdisciplinary movement of thinkers, doers,
        makers, shakers, artists, technologists, researchers, activists,
        organizers, and entrepreneurs, vanguarding a new paradigm for creativity
        and innovation that rewards liberation and abundance, not exclusion,
        extraction, and exploitation.

      <Paragraph>
        radical communities, particularly black, brown, feminized, poor and
        working creators, must champion modern advancements like blockchain and
        ai to realize their full revolutionary potential. these communities
        stand to most benefit from new systems of freedom and empowerment, and
        are best positioned to embrace them and spread them to the broader
        culture.
