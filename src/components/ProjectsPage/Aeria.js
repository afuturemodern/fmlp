        aeria is a music discovery technology that harnesses immersive,
        interactive, intuitive display to center recommendation AI on the human,
        not the platform, augmenting rather than automating. it reimagines
        digital media discovery as a virtual, visualized exploration space where
        creators connect dots, innovate, and chart their own pathways to success
        in the future of art. our goal is to supercharge every artist's decision
        making with machine learning, enabling anyone to find and execute on
        creative opportunities at scale without a label.
