            Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer
            Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the AAA website
            <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees
            and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the
            AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
            Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through
            the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
            will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
            reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
            applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
            fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
            AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Los
            Angeles, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
            Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
            proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
            enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

            If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
            arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
            state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, and the
            Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
            personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
            venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application
            of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
            Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
            (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use. If this provision is
            found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect

            provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute

            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a className-action basis or to utilize className

            of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be

            any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
